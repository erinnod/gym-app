# Juggernaut Gym App

This is my third React Project.

Welcome to the Gym App! This is a simple and intuitive application designed to help users manage their gym routines and track their workouts. Built with React for the frontend and Node.js/Express for the backend, this app provides a seamless experience for fitness enthusiasts.
Features

    Workout Management: View, and cycle through workouts.

    Exercise Tracking: Log reps for each workout.

    Responsive Design: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.

Technologies Used

    Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

    Backend: Node.js

    Styling: TailwindCSS (custom styles)

## What I learnt doing this project

This project was an opportunity to deepen my understanding of web development technologies and best practices. Here are the key skills and knowledge I gained:


### React Navigation and Routing

I learned how to use window.location.href to programmatically navigate between different sections of the app. This allowed me to create a smooth experience by dynamically redirecting users based on their actions (e.g., after clicking the 'Accept & Begin' and 'Formulate' buttons).


### Advanced Tailwind CSS

I improved my knowledge in Tailwind CSS, a CSS framework. Specifically, I learned how to:

- Apply box shadows to create depth and visual hierarchy in the UI.

- Use gradient styling to design appealing backgrounds and components.

- Leverage Tailwind's responsive design utilities like (sm md lg) to ensure the app looks good on all screen sizes.


### CSS and Styling Techniques

I improved my CSS skills by experimenting with advanced styling techniques, such as:

- Creating gradient backgrounds and overlays to enhance the visual appeal of the app.

- Using flexbox and grid for responsive and flexible layouts.

- Implementing animations and transitions to make the UI more interactive and engaging.


### React State Management with useState

I enhanced my understanding of React's useState hook for managing component-level state. This allowed me to:

- Dynamically update the UI based on user interactions (e.g., toggling forms, displaying correct reps).

- Control the flow of data between components, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
  

### Responsive Design

I gained hands-on experience in creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. By using Tailwind's responsive utilities, I ensured that the app provides an optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.


### Debugging and Problem-Solving

Throughout the project, I encountered and resolved various challenges, such as:

- Debugging issues with state management and component re-rendering.

- Fixing layout inconsistencies across different browsers and devices.

- Optimising performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders and improving code structure.

These experiences strengthened my problem-solving skills and taught me how to approach debugging systematically.
